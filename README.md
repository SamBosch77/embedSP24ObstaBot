Milestone 1 Check-in:
- Be ambitious with your goals, but make them realistic in the sense that you can guarantee a minimum viable product that accomplishes most of that goal by the deadline
- Create a hierarchy of tasks that contribute most to you your minimum viable product and work on those first. Add additional/special functionality later.
- Don't delegate tasks between members of the group; find times to work together as a team on developing the project robot
